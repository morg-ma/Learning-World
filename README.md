# Learning World - Version 1

ðŸš€ **Excited to Launch Our Graduation Project: Learning World - Version 1!** ðŸš€

My team and I are thrilled to unveil **Learning World**, our graduation project from the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) .NET Web Developer track**. This e-learning platform is designed to transform educational engagement, offering a powerful, user-friendly space for students, teachers, and institutions alike.
